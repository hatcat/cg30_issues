## The public issues repository for the book "Beautiful C++: 30 Core Guidelines for Writing Clean, Safe and Fast code"

Many thanks for participating in the proofing effort for this book. 

I don't really know much about proofing. I don't know if there is such a thing as too many proofers, or too much proofing. What I DO know is that there are mistakes in this book just like there are mistakes in any sufficiently large piece of code. All checking is good checking: spelling, grammar, correctness, comprehensibility, engagement... report on anything you think could be improved. If you think a picture or diagram would improve things do say so: I have an artist at my disposal, which is nice since I have the artistic talent of a drunken Neanderthal. If you are feeling positively saintly in your diligence, you could even add a brief pencil sketch and let the artist turn it into something of magical clarity.

I'm not kidding about the mistakes. I have found some utter howlers already. Goodness knows how they got in there. Editing errors, sleepy hands at the keyboard, complete ignorance of a corner of the language... this is why I need YOUR HELP. Feel free to judge: I just want to be a better programmer, teacher and evangelist of C++.

When submitting issues, please use the labels created for each edit and chapter to locate the source. Stable indices are a luxury I don't have here.

The word count is about 90K, split into 30 chapters of roughly equal size. Think of it as 30 blog posts. I will be releasing edits to you periodically as single PDF files, until you decline further participation or Addison Wesley say "enough, it's going to the printers now." We're aiming for publication towards the end of October, so I imagine the proofing deadline will be end of July. I'm really just making this up though. I know nothing about late stage book development. This really is an exciting new journey of learning and discovery for me. I'll update the deadline as new information becomes available.

For participating via issue submission you will receive a credit in the preface, a copy of the book when it's finished if you really want one, and my eternal gratitude. I may also be getting t-shirts printed. Watch this space...

Cheers,
G
