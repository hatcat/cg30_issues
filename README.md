## The public issues repository for the book "Beautiful C++: 30 Core Guidelines for Writing Clean, Safe and Fast code"

Many thanks for participating in the proofing effort for this book. 

I don't really know much about proofing. I don't know if there is such a thing as too many proofers, or too much proofing. What I DO know is that there are mistakes in this book just like there are mistakes in any sufficiently large piece of code. All checking is good checking: spelling, grammar, correctness, comprehensibility, engagement... report on anything you think could be improved. If you think a picture or diagram would improve things do say so: I have an artist at my disposal, which is nice since I have the artistic talent of a drunken Neanderthal. If you are feeling positively saintly in your diligence, you could even add a brief pencil sketch and let the artist turn it into something of magical clarity.

I'm not kidding about the mistakes. I have found some utter howlers already. Goodness knows how they got in there. Editing errors, sleepy hands at the keyboard, complete ignorance of a corner of the language... this is why I need YOUR HELP. Feel free to judge: I just want to be a better programmer, teacher and evangelist of C++.

When submitting issues, please provide the page number, paragraph, line number and word. The more detail, the better my chances of effecting a repair should a second edition be called for.

For participating via issue submission you will receive a credit in the preface and my eternal gratitude.

Cheers,
G
